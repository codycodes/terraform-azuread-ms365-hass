## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```hcl
module "ms365_hass_calendar" {
  source = "codycodes/ms365-hass/azuread"
  
  tenant_id        = "your-tenant-id"
  selected_service = "calendar"
}
```

Please see the [examples](./examples) folder for more configurations.

### Setup

You can choose to set this up in either Azure Cloud Shell (easiest, but may have associated cloud cost) or by downloading the tools and running them from your machine (free).

#### Option 1: Azure Cloud Shell

**Pros:** No software installation, always up-to-date tools, integrated authentication
**Cons:** Minimal storage costs for Cloud Shell usage (~$1-2/month typical)

Start by clicking this button or link to [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com)

[![Launch Azure Cloud Shell](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/includes/media/cloud-shell-try-it/hdi-launch-cloud-shell.png)](https://shell.azure.com)


**Continue with [Shared Setup Steps](#shared-setup-steps) below**

#### Option 2: Locally Installed (free)

<!-- TODO -->
* terraform
* az
* git (not needed but helpful)


#### Shared Setup Steps

```shell
git clone https://github.com/codycodes/terraform-azuread-ms365-hass.git


# choose which template you want to use from the examples directory to a directory of your choosing
cp terraform-azuread-ms365-hass/examples/single_service .

az login # only needs to be run when *not* using Azure Cloud Shell

# this command will fetch the Tenant ID, which is needed for the Terraform azuread provider and used in the next step
az account show --query tenantId -o tsv
```

Create a new file and add the following to it (updating selected_service if needed):

```hcl
tenant_id        = "tenant-id-from-az-command"
selected_service = "todo"
```

Save the file as `ms365.tfvars`

After confirming, run the following command to create your infra:

```shell
terraform apply -var-file="ms365.tfvars" -auto-approve
```

To fetch the client secret you can run:

```shell
terraform output client_secret
```

You can now follow the instructions on the [Authentication](https://rogerselwyn.github.io/MS365-ToDo/authentication.html) page of your respective integration(s) to set them up in Home Assistant. Happy Automating! ü§ñ
